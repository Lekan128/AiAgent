### NOT FOR LIBRARY USER
## üìù NOTE TO FUTURE SELF (GPG for Maven Central)

For gpg key, you need gpg key to sign the library
Check parent pom.xml 
<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
<artifactId>maven-gpg-plugin</artifactId>

To generate GPG key
Step A ‚Äî Install GPG if you dont already have it with `brew install gnupg` in your CLI for MAC OS
Step B ‚Äî Generate a key pair, Run:`gpg --full-generate-key`
    Choose RSA and RSA (option 1).
    Choose key size: 4096 (secure, recommended).
    Expiration: You can set ‚Äú0‚Äù (never expires) or ‚Äú2y‚Äù (2 years).
    Enter your full name and email (use the same email as in your GitHub/Maven Central account).
    Add a comment if you like (e.g release key for maven)
    Add a passphrase (important, don‚Äôt forget it).
        If you come across any issue run(like not asking for pass phrase):
        ```
        gpgconf --kill gpg-agent
        gpgconf --launch gpg-agent
        ```
        And use a full screen terminal
    This generates:
    Private key ‚Üí stays on your machine, used to sign. 
    Public key ‚Üí uploaded to a server so Maven Central can verify.
Step C ‚Äî List your keys (not required) `gpg --list-keys`
You‚Äôll see something like, when you list or generate your key:
```BASH
pub   rsa4096 2025-10-04 [SC]
ABCD1234EF5678901234567890ABCDEF12345678
uid           [ultimate] Olalekan Amoo <youremail@example.com>
sub   rsa4096 2025-10-04 [E]
```
Step D ‚Äî Publish your public key
Send it to a keyserver Maven Central can see (like keys.openpgp.org):
`gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --send-keys ABCD1234EF5678901234567890ABCDEF12345678`

Step E ‚Äî Configure Maven to use the key
For mac os, in your `~/.m2/settings.xml`:

```XML
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>gpg.passphrase</id>
      <passphrase>YOUR_PASSPHRASE</passphrase>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```
Then in your main(parent in my cae) pom.xml, under <profiles>:
```xml
<profiles>
  <profile>
    <id>release</id>
    <properties>
      <gpg.passphrase>${gpg.passphrase}</gpg.passphrase>
    </properties>
  </profile>
</profiles>
```
Then run `mvn clean deploy -Prelease`, or `mvn clean deploy -Prelease -Dgpg.passphrase="YOUR_PASSPHRASE"` to include your passphrase
Maven will sign (.asc files appear next to jars/poms).

- Only the public key is uploaded (safe). The private key stays on my machine.
- Maven uses this with maven-gpg-plugin to sign all JARs and POMs during:
  mvn clean deploy -Prelease
- This creates .asc files next to jars/poms (detached signatures).
- Maven Central requires these signatures to accept my artifacts.

# TL;DR GPG KEYS
I generated a GPG key for Maven Central on the 5th of Oct 2025.
Command used: `gpg --full-generate-key`
Type: RSA 4096
Expiration: Never
Email: mail@gmail.com
Keyserver: hkps://keys.openpgp.org
Published public key using: gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --send-keys D607798E124541F905037CEB5DCCE6FEC886C4ED
Passphrase: [stored in password manager] ;) I don't use it
Usage: Signing Maven Java libraries (Sonatype releases)
This key is used by Maven during mvn deploy to sign artifacts for Central.
To export or share gpg with anothe computer: `gpg --export-secret-keys --armor <your@email.com> > private-key.asc`
    Then move that file (private-key.asc) to your new machine (safely ‚Äî never share it publicly!), and import it there: `gpg --import private-key.asc`
    Verify it is imported: `gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG`

Do you need one GPG key per email?
No ‚Äî but it‚Äôs best practice to have one GPG key per identity (email)
So, as long as your GPG key‚Äôs email matches your GitHub/Maven Central account email, you‚Äôre good.

When you run `mvn clean deploy -Prelease` and you have the Maven GPG plugin configured, Maven runs: `gpg --sign`
By default, GPG looks for your default key, which you can check with:`gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG`
